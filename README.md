# Cypress_MCU_PSOC5_interfacing_protocols
Cypres MCU CY8C55xx series coding and implemented most of the common peripherals required for the drone development such as : I2C , UART, PWM, USB, CAN bus protocols. The GUI based development software is PSOC Creator and the programmer required is cypress PSOC 3.

## PWM  ::  BLDC motors 
## UART ::  TSminiF lidar, Telemetry
## USB  ::  Any external computer / RPI to be used as slave
## I2C  ::  LSM9DS1 IMU 
## CAN  ::  TMotor Cubemars AK70 BLDC motor (application: for robotic dog legs)
